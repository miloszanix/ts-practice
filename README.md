# TypeScript Practice Repository

This repository serves as a practice ground for honing my skills in TypeScript programming language. It contains various TypeScript projects and exercises that I have worked on to deepen my understanding of the language's concepts and features. By practicing TypeScript in this repository, I aim to improve my ability to write robust, statically typed code and leverage TypeScript's powerful type system.

## Features and Concepts Explored

Throughout my practice sessions, I have focused on exploring and applying the following features and concepts of TypeScript:

- Static typing: Leveraging TypeScript's static type system to catch errors at compile-time and enhance code reliability.
- Interfaces and types: Defining custom interfaces and types to ensure consistent data structures and contracts.
- Classes and object-oriented programming: Using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to build modular and reusable code.
- Generics: Employing generics to write flexible and reusable functions and data structures.
- Modules and namespaces: Organizing code into modules and namespaces for better code organization and encapsulation.
- Type annotations and inference: Understanding how TypeScript's type inference works and when to use explicit type annotations.
- Advanced type system features: Exploring advanced type system features such as union types, intersection types, mapped types, conditional types, and more.
- Tooling and integration: Configuring TypeScript with popular development tools, such as linters, formatters, and build systems.

## Contributing
